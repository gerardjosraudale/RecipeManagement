# Overview

As a software engineering student, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skill set by taking on projects that challenge my coding abilities and understanding C#.

## Description

The Recipe Management System is a C# console application that allows users to add, search, and organize their recipes by categories. This software demonstrates key C# programming concepts such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming principles. The system is composed of three core files: Program.cs, Recipe.cs, and RecipeManager.cs, and enables users to manage their personal recipe collection efficiently.

## Purpose

The purpose of writing this software was to create a practical, hands-on project to deepen my understanding of the C# language. This project serves as an example of how core programming concepts such as data structures, classes, and methods can be applied to solve a real-world problem. Through building this application, I learned how to handle user input, manage lists of objects, and implement simple search and display functionalities.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
